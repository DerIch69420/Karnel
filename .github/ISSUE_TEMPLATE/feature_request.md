## 🛠️ **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Yes. I am once again asking for your support 😔

> "Every time I try to do *that one thing*, the app says 'nope' and crashes harder than my motivation on a Monday morning 😵‍💫."

Basically, it's pain. 🫠  
Pure, unfiltered, 200% **Certified Meme Pain™**.

---

## 🌈 **Describe the solution you'd like**

✨✨✨ **MAKE IT WORK, BUT LIKE, MAGICALLY** ✨✨✨

I want the app to vibe with me, understand my soul, and just... do the thing.  
Like:  
- Add a button 🔘  
- Make it go *brrr* 🌀  
- Profit 💸

> Think less “it kinda works” and more “Elon just DM'd me ‘nice feature bro’”.

## 🧪 **Describe alternatives you've considered**

- Praying to the Stack Overflow gods 🙏  
- Sacrificing RAM sticks to the Debug Deities 💾🔥  
- Crying in binary: `01000011 01110010 01111001` 😭

But alas, nothing worked. 💀
