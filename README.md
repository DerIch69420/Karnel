# Karnel
Karnel is the typo-free non-bloated language for everything you need!

## No bloat
### Enable
You might be wondering why Karnel is non-bloated. <br>
This is because you **must** enable the key features. <br>

This enables the language itself. It is needed in **every** Karnel program.
```
enable Karnel
```

Other important things to enable are:
```
enable Comments \\ To allow the use of this comment
enable Memory \\ To allow the use of memory
enable Executable \\ To allow the program to be executed 
```

You might think that ```enable``` itself is bloated. <br>
And you are right. <br>

To prevent this you can disable it. 
```
enable disable \\ To disable stuff

disable enable \\ Disable enable
disable disable \\ Disable disable again
```
