# Rust
Karnel is a very powerful language, but one day everything will be rewritten to Rust.
To make the rustification process easier it is recommended that add the beginning of every program you include the corresponding Rust code as comments.

## Still use Karnel?
If you still want to use Karnel, you can read its documentation here [Documentation Yay!!!!](Readme.md).
